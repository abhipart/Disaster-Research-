The field team interviewed public and nonprofit decision makers and analyzed agency reports and news media accounts. In May of 2010 James Kendra and Sudha Arlikatti (University of North Texas) and Manuel Torres (University of Delaware) traveled to the Miami area for interviews and site visits."

The reception process of incoming evacuees from Haiti was also observed at Miami International Airport. Informal interviews were conducted with participants involved in these activities. Later, research was conducted in Port-au-Prince and Leogane, Haiti to attempt to understand the causes of the initial delay in the international relief as blamed on a shortage of trucks and warehouses, and the organization of this effort from the logistical viewpoint once started. The study consisted of 25 qualitative interviews with key informants from the United Nations agencies, the Red Cross, the representatives of grassroots organizations and the citizenry."

In this RAPID project, we studied the San Bruno explosion and fire with the aims of (a) improving understanding of how urban fires spread and are suppressed, (b) supporting development and validation of next-generation urban fire simulation models, and (c) advancing theories of resilience. An interdisciplinary field team gathered data that provided a holistic account of the event across the engineering and social sciences. In particular, the team examined the composition and distribution of structures, rate and means of fire spread, local topography and weather conditions, and elements of multi-organizational coordination and decision making."

In this RAPID project we studied the fire-related aspects of the March 2011 Japan earthquake with the aims to improve understanding of where, when, and how fires ignite, how fires spread through a neighborhood, and how they ignite and are suppressed in industrial facilities. The project involved three main steps: (1) collecting data on the fire-related aspects of the event through site visits, interviews with key informants, and secondary data sources; (2) compiling the data into easily usable, comprehensive databases that include all data on each fire and relevant auxiliary data in a consistent format; and (3) analyzing the data through descriptive statistics, fitting generalized linear statistical models to the ignition data, and comparing observations of spread to that estimated by a new physics-based urban fire spread model."
